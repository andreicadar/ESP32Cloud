# ESP32 CloudSD card storage accessed wireless in LAN via HTTP server running on ESP32 and locally via a joystick and an OLED display.## Components<ul>    <li>ESP32 board :globe_with_meridians:</li>    <li>SD card reader SPI</li>    <li>SSD 1306 SPI OLED display :tv:</li>	<li>AT24C256 I^2^C EEPROM memory module</li>    <li>Joystick :joystick:</li>    <li>Jumper Wires</li></ul>![Project](images/project.jpg)## UsageThe user can navigate through folders and files of the SD card by using the joystick.### Configuration stored in external EEPROM moduleThe Access Point's credentials are stored in the AT24C256 256Kb memory.<br>They are stored at adresses **0x1337** and **0xbeef**.![Project](images/eepromRead.png)### Controls :joystick:<ul>    <li>Left: go back one directory</li>    <li>Right / Press: if the selected is a directory navigate to it</li>    <li>Up: scroll up</li>	<li>Down: scroll down</li></ul><br>![FolderStructure](images/oledFolderStructure.jpg)<br><br>If a folder is empty, an appropiate message is displayed.<br>![EmptyDirOled](images/oledDirEmpty.jpg)<br><br>Since the project is meant to be a cloud, the files can also be accessed from a browser via the running HTTP Server.<br>When entering the root page of the server, together with a welcome message, the file structure of the root folder is presented. Folders have a folder emoji next to them and their name is a link, which when it is clicked redirects the player to a page containg that folder's file strucure. When we want to navigate back to a folder we simply press the back button of the browser.<br>![WebMainPage](images/webMainPage.png)<br><br>Images also have a specific emoji next to them.![WebImageEmoji](images/webPhotoEmoji.png)<br><br>If a folder is empty, a specific message is displayed on the webpage.![WebEmptyFolder](images/webDirectoryEmpty.png)
